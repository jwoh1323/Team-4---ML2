**News Category Detection**

This repsoitory represent the codings used for each prediction task. 
For the rating prediction task, we implemented a latent factor model with regularization.
For the purchase prediction task, we used a decision tree combined with similarity index using a Jaccard index. 
For the category prediction, we used a convolutional neural network as well as a logistic regression with count vectorization.
